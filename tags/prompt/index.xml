I’m based in the UK and we just received the announcement last week that we have at least three more weeks of lockdown. I’ve been working at home for over a month now and I feel really lucky that I can work from home. There are a lot of folks who can’t and are instead working hard on the front lines to keep us safe and well. Firstly, a shout out to those folks! Thanks for all your doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this is not a post on how to set up your home office, or how to be the most productive work from home employee. This is a post to solve one simple problem.  I’ve no idea what day it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monday through Friday I wake up, drink some coffee and then head to my desk to work my day job. I usually workout in the garden with my wife at lunch and then we walk after work. Every day is pretty much the same, so I’ve written an earth-shattering PowerShell function for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>function Find-WhatDayAreWeDoing {
param (
[switch]$Raw
)&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>if($raw) {
(Get-Date).DayOfWeek
}
else {
(&amp;quot;We're doing {0} today!&amp;quot; -f (Get-Date).DayOfWeek)
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add this into your profile and then simply just call the function to remind you what day we’re on.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve also added the &lt;code>-Raw&lt;/code> switch so you can use that to just return the day, this is useful if you wanted to add it into your prompt.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To change the prompt in PowerShell you just need to create a function called ‘Prompt’. For example, if I run this in my PowerShell session or put it in my profile, I’ll be able to see what day it is constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>function Prompt {
Write-Host (&amp;quot;[{0}] PS&amp;gt; &amp;quot; -f (Find-WhatDayAreWeDoing -raw))
}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://jpomfret.github.io/images/prompt1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prompt is a really useful snippet of code and there are many  great ideas out there. I use the amazing &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbatools.io/prompt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dbatools prompt&lt;/a>. Their prompt lists the current time and the execution time for the last statement run. You could change it to add in the day also:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll be honest, development on &lt;code>Set-WhatDayWeAreDoing&lt;/code> is not going as well. Stay safe folks and keep keeping on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
