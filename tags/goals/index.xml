I’m pretty sure none of us could have predicted how the world would look now and it won’t be regarded as the best year ever. However, there were definitely still some bright points I’d like to make note of before setting some targets for 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looking-back-on-2020">Looking back on 2020&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of my biggest achievements of the year was being awarded &lt;a class="link" href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003655?fullName=Jess%20Pomfret" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MVP for Cloud and Datacenter Management&lt;/a> in February. I’m really proud of this and my ability to positively contribute to our data and PowerShell communities. Along with that I managed to publish 25 blog posts and added two videos to my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0D3eA_natUs91YcuPE_tLg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>YouTube channel&lt;/a>.  I also gave 10 presentations, only one in person, and also sat on two diversity and inclusion panels. I’ve also continued to contribute to dbatools, dbachecks and other open source software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside of the tech world, it was a year of cancelled plans and lockdowns.  I will say this gave me and my wife plenty of time to explore our local footpaths. I recorded over 460 miles of walking last year. Something we usually wouldn’t have had time for.  I also cycled just over 700 miles after getting a new bike in June.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looking-forward-to-2021">Looking forward to 2021&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now, I’m not going to say 2021 is going to be back to normal, who knows if we’ll ever go back to that normal.  However, I’m hopeful that things will be better than 2020, and I hope sooner rather than later we can get back to travelling and actually meeting up with people in person!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m going to set some targets to aim for that won’t depend on what 2021 looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Publish 26 blog posts – this would average to one every fortnight. I also aim to publish at a regular cadence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create 10 YouTube videos – my short ‘life hack’ videos that I’ve published have got positive reviews. I aim to get more of those recorded and available on YouTube&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speaking – I don’t have a specific number target here, but I’d like to think I can beat last year&amp;rsquo;s total of 10 presentations. Perhaps even some at in person events?!?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open source contributions – Again, no specific numbers here but just a goal to continue contributing. I also have some ideas for this area that need a little love and time, but I hope to work on those this year as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cycle 1000 miles – this would be more than I’ve ever cycled in a year, but without a commute in 2020 I found a lot more time for cycling before/after work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Duolingo streak – another non tech goal. I’ve been using Duolingo to work on my French and hope to keep the streak alive throughout 2021.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All in all, I hope 2021 is an improvement on 2020 – here’s to doing everything I can to make it a good one. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of local views I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed while cycling\walking this past year.&lt;/p>

I never imagined when I started this blog in February that I would be going into 2019 even more excited to give back to the community. Public speaking is not something that comes easy to me, and in fact I find it pretty terrifying, which is why I’m amazed at how much I enjoyed presenting this past year.  The SQL Server community is definitely a special group of professionals, so thank you to any and all of you who have made this year one of my best yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I’m all about goals and targets so in May I wrote a T-SQL Tuesday post about giving back to the community and I set several goals to complete in 2018, let’s review.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="10-blog-posts-on-jesspomfretcom-3-technical">10 blog posts on JessPomfret.com (3 technical)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This year end summary makes 12 posts for the year, and 7 were technical posts. My most popular post was ‘&lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com/checking-backups-with-dbachecks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Checking backups with dbachecks&lt;/a>’.  I also contributed a guest post on the dbatools blog covering &lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com/checking-backups-with-dbachecks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>migrating application databases.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="50-prs-to-dbatoolsdbachecks">50 PR’s to dbatools/dbachecks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This goal was to encourage contributions to open source projects.  My involvement with dbatools and dbachecks is what got me started down this path of blogging and speaking so I wanted to make sure I didn’t lose sight of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far in 2018 I have 40 pull requests to dbatools and 12 to dbachecks, so I have met my goal here with a few days to spare.  I also contributed to a few other open source projects this year, I had 3 PRs accepted to the Microsoft Sql-Docs repository, and I have 2 open PRs to the SqlServerDsc module.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-user-group--1-other-presentation">1 user group &amp;amp; 1 ‘other’ presentation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This goal I surprised myself with, I thought this would be the hardest one to meet and it ended up being the most rewarding.  I presented my &lt;a class="link" href="https://jesspomfret.com/first-user-group-presentation-i-survived/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>first ever session&lt;/a> to the Ohio North SQL Server User Group in June, it went ok. My topic was data compression and I found myself sweating, rushing and a little short on content.  With some amazing feedback and support I added some content and delivered it again at SQL Saturday Columbus and it went much better. I then presented it for a third time to the DBA Fundamentals Virtual chapter, which was good although a little strange not being able to see your audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also presented a PSPowerHour lightening talk on apply data compression with dbatools, I’d say I well exceeded this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looking-forward-to-2019">Looking forward to 2019&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My main goal for 2019 is to improve my blog, regular content is going to be the most important part of increasing my traffic so I’m going to aim for 26 blog posts in 2019.  I’m also excited to already have two speaking engagements on the calendar as I aim for 5 presentations this year. My data compression session has been accepted to SQL Saturday Cleveland, and a new session I’m working on ‘Installing SQL Server with PowerShell DSC’ was selected for DataGrillen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope everyone has a great last few days of 2018 and starts 2019 strong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheers!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
